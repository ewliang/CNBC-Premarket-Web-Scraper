# CNBC-Premarket-Web-Scraper
A web scraper created using Puppeteer library on the backend to scrape the stock market prediction data off of CNBC's premarket page.

# FAQs
**Why is Puppeteer used instead of Cheerio?**
- Despite the performance benefits gained from using Cheerio, Cheerio was not used due to its lack of proper support for client side rendered pages built on SPAs like React.js, which in this case the CNBC site is built off of.
